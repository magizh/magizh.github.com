        LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLafksbfksbjvbsdljfbslljsbfjlabljdbaldjIn the process of taking a brief tour of 
        
        Ruby in Chapter 4, we learned about including the application stylesheet into the sample application—but
        , as noted in Section 4.3.4, this stylesheet is currently empty. In this chapter, we’ll change this by
        incorporating the Bootstrap framework into our application, and then we’ll add some custom styles of our 
        own.1 We’ll also start filling in the layout with links to the pages (such as Home and About) that we’ve 
        created so far (Section 5.1). Along the way, we’ll learn about partials, Rails routes, and the asset pipeline,
        including an introduction to Sass (Section 5.2). We’ll also refactor the tests from Chapter 3 using the latest 
        RSpec techniques. We’ll end by taking a first important step toward letting users sign up to our site.
